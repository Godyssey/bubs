            <p>
                I can admit that I never expected to go through what I did; to become <em> who </em> <br>I did without you. 
                I know that I'm truly the worst at words but I'm going to try anyway. <br><br>
                
                I never thought I’d find a connection as sweet as ours, <br>
                Like discovering the first ripe strawberry in spring. <br>
                It’s no exaggeration especially given my withered seasons <br>
                hat I cherished our moments, even before our words began to bloom. <br>
                You were something rare, rich, and fulfilling; A sweetness I hadn’t tasted in so long. <br>
                The joy of sharing you with others felt like tending a secret garden, <br>
                Something beautiful I was proud to nurture. <br>
                So thank you, for all that you are and all we grew together. <br>
                I’ll never forget the roots we planted, our beginning or our end— <br>
                For you are forever entwined in me, <br>
                And you’ll always belong to this heart, my ever-blooming strawberry garden.

                I felt indifferent to the withering of us, to the falling of our fruit. <br>
                I hated you, hated us. Yet, I longed for you, longed for us. <br>
                More than anything, I despised myself, but I loathed this barren field <br> 
                where everything once flourished and where I now missed the sweetness just as much <br> as I mourned it.

            <p>
                Seeing you again in our once treasured yet withering garden made my heart stop. <br>
                I couldn't possibly grasp why we were conversing now but I didn't despise it either. <br>
                Yet in my interest to mend the bond that was broken, the resentment I held surfaced once more. <br>
                It was fiery and seething, <br>
                I was livid and anxious. <br>
                But you were still and understanding. <br>
                Like a tree in the wind, you listened to my woes and unlike the rest, understood the root of my pain. <br>
                I was.. <strong>stubborn</strong>, <strong>aggressive</strong> and a little bit <strong>cagey</strong> 
                but you still came back.. you still stayed.. with me. <br><br>
                We sat and planted new memories with stronger vines to craddle our laughter and intimate language <br>
                trickling through sprinklers. We rebuilt this garden from the ground up and I'd do it again if only <br>
                to be with you. And though we kept distance for quite some time, I'd never stop yearning, <br> 
                longing for your return. I miss you, I love you. <br>
                I love you.
